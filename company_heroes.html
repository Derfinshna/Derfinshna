<p><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger:</strong> Arnold Schwarzenegger is well known around the world for 
not only his countless physical accomplishments, but also the many humanitarian 
works he has been involved with. Schwarzenegger served in American politics as the 
Governor of California from 2003-2011. He also appeared in many highly successful 
movies such as "The Terminator" and "True Lies." Schwarzenegger, however, became 
well known perhaps mostly for his exceptional bodybuilding career above anything 
else. He began lifting weights at the age of 15 and shortly thereafter, won "Mr. 
Universe" as well as numerous "Mr. Olympia" titles. In a nutshell, the highly 
versatile background of Schwarzenegger shows he is a truly well-rounded individual 
in terms of both intelligence and physical prowess. These are two skills that we 
hold to the highest regard here at Gym of Knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Kris Gethin:</strong> Kris Gethin is a well known fitness expert in the 
world of social media. He is from Wales, UK but currently resides in the USA. 
Gethin is an author of several books that discuss proper physical training and 
nutrition. He is our hero here at Gym of Knowledge due to the fact that he 
researches numerous training strategies in such detail and then attempts to 
educate the world on the most effective ones. Best known for the experiments 
he carried out on the body in order for it to become the best and most fit, 
Gethin practices bodybuilding with an athletic and endurance aspect in mind. 
He competes in triathlons and therefore stands out from the majority of 
bodybuilders, because after all, it is not too common to see many of them accomplish 
these highly enduring feats.
